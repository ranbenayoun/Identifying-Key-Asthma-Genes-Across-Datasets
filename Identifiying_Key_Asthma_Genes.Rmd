Abstract:
Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and tissue remodeling. Despite the availability of treatments, the molecular mechanisms underlying asthma and its subtypes remains not understood completely. In this project, we aimed to identify genes and biological pathways associated with asthma by integrating transcriptomic data from multiple datasets.

We analyzed bulk RNA-Seq data from asthma patients and controls derived from both epithelial and smooth muscle cells using the DESeq2 package. To improve the robustness of our analysis, we focused on common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared across all datasets, especially considering that datasets originating from the airway epithelial cells. This strategy allowed us to identify pathways consistently enriched across datasets, reducing dataset-specific noise while acknowledging that some biologically important pathways might be detected only in specific datasets.

Differential expression and subsequent enrichment analyses using Gene Ontology (GO), Reactome, and KEGG databases revealed biologically relevant processes, including neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, regulation of blood pressure, and extracellular matrix remodeling.

Additionally, ROC curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive potential of individual DEGs, although no genes showed strong discriminatory power between asthma and control samples. Finally, integration with the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) confirmed that several of the identified DEGs have previously been associated with asthma or related respiratory diseases, supporting the consistency of our findings with existing knowledge.

In conclusion, our analysis highlights neuro-immune signaling, vascular regulation, and extracellular matrix remodeling as key processes in asthma. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the disease's molecular basis and may inform future research on asthma pathophysiology.

Based on methods and analysis from: Identification of key genes and pathways between mild-moderate and severe asthmatics via bioinformatics analysis https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06675-w#Sec11

Biological Questions to Answer \
• How do these genes contribute to asthma progression? \
• Can specific genes be used as biomarkers for diagnosing asthma? \
• What pathways are involved in asthma disease? \
• Are there potential drug interactions that may influence these genes?

In GSE152004, asthmatic samples show dominant downregulation (3,200 genes) compared to upregulation (1,739 genes), suggesting that asthma in this dataset is associated with global transcriptional repression. In contrast, GSE58434 shows a more balanced pattern of up (920 genes) and downregulated genes (788), suggesting a moderate and more symmetric transcriptional response to asthma.

## Heatmap
```{r Heatmap}
# Extract significant genes
sig_gene_ids <- as.character(sig_genes1$gene_id)

# Prepare normalized counts
vsd <- vst(deseq_results1$dds, blind=FALSE)
norm_counts <- assay(vsd)

# Subset for significant genes
heatmap_data <- norm_counts[rownames(norm_counts) %in% sig_gene_ids, ]

# Scale genes
heatmap_data_scaled <- t(scale(t(heatmap_data)))  # Z-score scaling per gene

# Draw heatmap with annotations
pheatmap(heatmap_data_scaled,
         cluster_rows = TRUE,
         cluster_cols = TRUE,
         show_rownames = FALSE,
         fontsize_row = 6,
         fontsize_col = 8,
         main = "GSE58434 - Heatmap of Significant Genes (Asthma, Vitamin D, Albuterol)")
```
Based on the heatmap results we can see:
Asthma vs Control separation: The heatmap reveals a clear clustering between Asthma and Control samples, reflecting distinct gene expression profiles.
Similar expression patterns within groups: Samples within the same condition, including Asthma subgroups (Vitamin D or Albuterol treatment), exhibit similar gene expression patterns, indicating group-specific regulation.
Differentially regulated gene clusters: Several gene blocks are upregulated (red) in subsets of samples (e.g., Asthma) and downregulated (blue) in others (e.g., Control), suggesting condition- and treatment-associated gene expression changes.


##Pathway Enrichment Analysis
Using 3 different libraries of pathway enrichment; GO, KEGG, Reactome
Using Common DEGs (Genes Shared Across All Datasets) to find pathways that are consistently enriched across all datasets.
In case for datasets 2+3, they come from similar conditions (e.g., same disease, tissue type).
This might help us find robust and reproducible pathways that are not dataset-specific.
However, we may miss pathways that are enriched in only some datasets but still biologically important.
The common 17 DEG from dataset 2+3 are:
EDN2 | CLCA1 | ITLN1 | ITLN2 | GRIA2 | ATRNL1 | HBD | PRB4 | PRB1 | PRB2 | KRT76 | CNMD | HS6ST3 | CTSG | LOC105370481 | TPSAB1 | CST4
The common DEG for all datasets is HBD - Hemoglobin subunit delta

In the KEGG analysis, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and Salivary secretion were the top enriched pathways. The neuroactive pathway is highly relevant, as airway function is strongly regulated by the autonomic nervous system. Neuro-immune interactions and neurogenic inflammation are well-known contributors to asthma, influencing bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and airway sensitivity. The enrichment of Salivary secretion may reflect shared secretory or smooth muscle regulation mechanisms between the airways and salivary glands.

The GO analysis highlighted processes related to blood pressure regulation, which are relevant to asthma due to the close link between vascular and airway function. Molecules like angiotensin, nitric oxide, and endothelin not only regulate blood pressure but also affect airway smooth muscle and remodeling, likely explaining the enrichment in these pathways.

The Reactome analysis identified Activation of Matrix Metalloproteinases as significantly enriched. MMPs play a central role in airway remodeling, inflammation, and tissue degradation, all of which are hallmarks of asthma pathogenesis, making this finding highly relevant.

## Comparative Toxicogenomics Analysis

The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a valuable resource that provides curated information on chemical-gene interactions, chemical-disease associations, and gene-disease relationships. It enables researchers to explore how environmental exposures influence biological processes and disease pathways. In our study, we utilized CTD to investigate potential chemical interactions with our differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Using the Batch Query tool, we uploaded our list of 17 DEGs to systematically retrieve relevant chemical associations. The results were structured hierarchically, allowing us to identify both direct interactions (chemicals known to interact with our DEGs) and indirect ones (chemicals influencing genes that are functionally related to our DEGs). This hierarchical approach helped us uncover key chemicals that may play a role in regulating or disrupting biological pathways relevant to our study.

Looking at HBD chemical-gene interaction shows us many relation, we chose to filter out the weak relations and leave significant chemicals with interactions and afinity to this gene. using CTD database can help us find chemicals to indicate as immunogens, reactants or even as drugs for treatment. 

This visualization from the CTD highlights the interactions between a single gene (HBD) and several chemicals, including Ethinyl Estradiol, Progesterone, and Bisphenol A. We filtered this graph to show a more focused interaction pattern, identifying a more direct influence of specific chemicals on the gene of interest. This targeted interaction may provide clearer insights into potential regulatory or toxicological effects, making it a useful candidate for further validation in pathway or functional studies.

Our analysis using the CTD to explore interactions between the 17 DEGs and chemicals highlights the complexity of gene-environment interactions. The network visualization shows a dense and interconnected structure, indicating that multiple chemicals are linked to several genes, reinforcing the intricate nature of regulatory pathways. This complexity underscores the challenge of isolating meaningful gene-chemical associations and suggests that additional layers of analysis, may be required to derive more conclusive insights.

## ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis

We want to use Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess the diagnostic power of the differentially expressed genes we identified. ROC analysis helps us evaluate how well these genes can distinguish between disease and control groups based on their expression levels. 
By plotting the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity), we can quantify each gene’s predictive performance using the Area Under the Curve (AUC). A higher AUC (closer to 1) indicates a gene with strong discriminatory power, while an AUC close to 0.5 suggests no predictive ability. We expect to see some genes with AUC > 0.7, which would indicate they have potential as biomarkers for the condition under study. If no genes exceed this threshold, it suggests that either the signal is weak, or other factors contribute to disease classification. This analysis ultimately helps us prioritize genes for further validation in biomarker discovery or disease classification.

Our ROC analysis showed that none of the identified genes had an AUC greater than 0.7, indicating that they lack strong discriminatory power between the disease and control groups. This suggests that these genes alone may not serve as reliable biomarkers, and further analysis or integration with other data may be needed.
